# taxconv

A very simple CAD ($ CA) ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ to EUR (â‚¬) ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º converter that allows European travellers in Canada to quickly convert prices in Canadian dollars to Euros while taking into account the provincial sales tax (e.g., Quebec QST or British Columbia PST) and the Goods and Services Tax (GST).

## Why?

While I was shopping in Quebec, not being used to adding taxes to the displayed prices, I found myself constantly having to manually add taxes to the prices, then convert the total to Euros. This was a bit of a hassle, so I decided to write a simple app to do it for me. Later I added support for British Columbia as well.
